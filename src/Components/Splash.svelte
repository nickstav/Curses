        <p> 
            Orison is an app that allows you to create a [UI / GUI / progress screen / whatever you want*] 
            for command-line interpreters such as cmd.exe quickly and efficiently using a canvas tool.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Once finished with your design, hit the save button to download a Python script that uses the Curses
            library to build [whatever you just did] when run using the usual "python** script.py" command in
            your command prompt shell.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Thanks for visiting this app, please get in touch with any suggestions*** as future versions will be upcoming!

        <p>(* - "whatever you want" here means "whatever you want that you can do in the app")</p>
        <p>(** - or python3 or whatever personalised command you have chosen as your own)</p>
        <p>(*** - criticisms are also welcome)</p>
